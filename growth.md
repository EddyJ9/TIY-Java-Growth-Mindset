The article talking about growth mindset was very helpful in making me want to strive to learn and grow as much as I can. I have to admit that when I was younger I had the fixed mindset for awhile and did not
realize what I was doing to myself in the long run. However, as I grew up I found challenges and setbacks to be more helpful in allowing me to grow my concept around the work. Having a growth mindset in this
course will be essential in order to succeed. The fast pace of learning will be extremely difficult and mistakes will be made, many of times. However, having the growth mindset will allow myself and my fellow
classmates to take our setbacks as ways to grow and learn more in order to be successful in our programming paths.  

Learning java, as well as other skills, that would normally take two years or more in a matter of three months is very frightening to most people. Most people will be pushed away from the challenge due to
the thought of having a lot of work to do, as well as investing countless numbers of hours into practice and research. However, there are a handful of people that will accept the challenge, even though the 
warning of difficulty has been clarified many times. Having this mindset of wanting to grow overal is important in a persons' everyday life. I feel this three month course will not only help me become a 
junior software developer, but allow me to grow as a person with the number of challenges that await.
